Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:Mayo Clinic,97.1,95.7,,,,Good,2019-12-31T17:07:55.090Z,2019-12-31T17:07:55.090Z

Strains OV254, ATCC 35782, 94-2272 and Maus IV were sequenced at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Hinxton, UK) using a Genome Analyzer IIx device, while strain Maus III was sequenced at the Biomics platform of the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) using a HiSeq 2500 device. First, Raw PacBio subreads were assembled using Canu and generated supercontigs were then organized as compared to the genome of M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2 using MeDuSa. Second, Illumina read pairs were trimmed using Trimmomatic. Complete read pairs were then assembled using SPAdes and providing either raw PacBio subreads or the scaffolds of PacBio supercontigs. Illumina contigs thus generated were then compared to the PacBio scaffolds using BLASTN to correct erroneous arrangements and to fill undefined gaps. Third, Illumina read pairs were mapped against the resulting assembled genome using BWA-MEM.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree.

Drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has been one of the most important nosocomial pathogens with the highest incidence rate of isolation among Acinetobacter species. The genus Acinetobacter composes 62 distinct species with validly published names and several species with effectively published names awaiting validation. Acinetobacter variabilis was originally classified as Acinetobacter DNA group 15 TU using DNA-DNA hybridization by Tjernberg and Ursing in 1989. Later, Acinetobacter DNA group 15 TU was proposed as Acinetobacter variabilis sp. nov. in 2015 by Krizova L., et al. Since NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli was initially detected in 2008 in Sweden, NDM-type MBL producers have become endemic in the India, and these organisms were isolated in various countries and regions worldwide. Although NDM-type MBL producers seem to be not yet spreading in Japan, there is at least four reports of NDM producing clinical isolates, including an isolate of E. coli producing NDM-1 MBL obtained from a patient traveling India for business in March 2009, and two isolates of NDM-5 MBL producing E. coli and NDM-1 MBL producing K. pneumoniae obtained from two foreigners from Bangladesh and Indonesia, respectively, and an isolate of E. coli producing NDM-7 obtained from a patient with history of admission in India. In Acinetobacter species, an isolate of NDM-1 MBL producing A. baumannii was obtained from a patient in Japan. The methylation of 16S rRNA confers high resistance to all clinically important aminoglycosides in Gram-negative organism. Clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring the armA, a 16S rRNA methylase, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring the rmtA, another one, were identified in 2003 in France, Japan, and the other countries since 2003. To date, 10 plasmid-associated 16S rRNA methylase genes, armA, rmtA-H and npmA, have been identified in human and animal.

Although of significant clinical relevance, complete genome sequences of only four clinical Cpn strains have been obtained. All of them were isolated from the respiratory tract and shared more than 99% sequence identity. Here we investigate genetic differences on the whole-genome level that are related to Cpn tissue tropism and pathogenicity. We have sequenced the genomes of 18 clinical isolates from different anatomical sites (e.g. lung, blood, coronary arteries) of diseased patients, and one animal isolate. In total 1,363 SNP loci and 184 InDels have been identified in the genomes of all clinical Cpn isolates. These are distributed throughout the whole chlamydial genome and enriched in highly variable regions. The genomes show clear evidence of recombination in at least one potential region but no phage insertions. The tyrP gene was always encoded as single copy in all vascular isolates. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed distinct evolutionary lineages containing primarily non-respiratory Cpn isolates. In one of these, clinical isolates from coronary arteries and blood monocytes were closely grouped together. They could be distinguished from all other isolates by characteristic nsSNPs in genes involved in RB to EB transition, inclusion membrane formation, bacterial stress response and metabolism. This study substantially expands the genomic data of Cpn and elucidates its evolutionary history. Cpn genetic differences related to tissue tropism not only indicate a specific role of the pathogen in the development of chronic disease, but also suggest the development of pathogen-oriented diagnostic strategies in the future.",isolate:PB2,99.8,99.7,100,,,Good,2016-01-17T16:02:18.021Z,2016-01-17T16:02:18.021Z

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

H37Ra has several different characteristics compared with its virulent sister strain H37Rv, including a rough, raised colony morphology, loss of cord formation, loss of neutral red dye binding,decreased ability to survive under anaerobic conditions, reduced ability to survive inside macrophages, and loss of virulence in guinea pigs, mice and rabbits. Despite numerous studies in the past 70 years, the molecular basis for the loss of virulencein H37Ra has remained obscure. In this project, we determined the whole genome sequence for the H37Ra strain from ATCC (ATCC 25177). The choice of the ATCC type strain of H37Ra is important as repeated in vitro culture is known to create changes in the genome. Determination of the genome sequence of H37Ra and comparative genome analysis of H37Ra with the recently sequenced virulent sister strain H37Rv is of critical importance not only for elucidating the mechanism of attenuation of virulence in H37Ra but also for understanding the virulence and pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis.",,99.9,99.9,100,,,Good,2014-12-08T22:12:10.267Z,2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z

In reproductive health, BV is of concern due to its associated risk for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae acquisition as well as preterm birth. BVAB1 has been shown to be associated with BV persistence after metronidazole treatment and increased vaginal inflammation, as well as conferring a higher risk of puerperal infections. To date, no complete genome of BVAB1 is available, which has made it difficult to understand its disease-associated features. We present here a comparative analysis including a complete genome and six metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of BVAB1 derived from cervicovaginal samples of seven separate women. The complete genome was obtained from a metagenome sequenced with long-read technology on a PacBio Sequel II instrument while the others were derived from metagenomes sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. The complete genome is 1.649 Mb long and encodes 1,578 genes. We propose to rename BVAB1 to “Candidatus Lachnocurva vaginae” based on phylogenetic analysis, and provide genomic evidence that this candidate species may metabolize D-lactate, produce trimethylamine (the chemical responsible for BV-associated odor), and be motile. The complete genome and assembled MAGs will be valuable resources contributing to our understanding of the heterogenous etiology of bacterial vaginosis.",sample_type:metagenomic assembly,95.9,95.5,,,,Good,2020-04-11T23:48:43.381Z,2020-04-11T23:48:43.381Z

We used fermentation characteristics, biochemical assays and fatty acid profiles for taxonomic analysis of EB-247T, and supplemented this with information derived from sub-genome- and genome- based analysis. Phenotypic and morphological tests revealed that the isolate is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, highly motile and facultatively anaerobic. Whole cell analysis showed that most of the fatty acids, with the exception of C17:0 Cyclo and C16:1ω6c/C16:1ω7c that were present in altered ratios, were typical for the Enterobacter species. We performed whole genome sequencing of EB-247T to perform subgenome-based phylogenetic analysis i.e. 16S rRNA, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and whole-genome-based taxonomic analysis. The draft genome of EB-247T was approximately 4.9 Mb in size with a G+C content of 56.0%. The 16S rDNA sequence of EB-247T showed > 97% similarity to all the Enterobacter species, while MLSA clustered EB-247T within Enterobacter but classified it as a separate species. Analysis using in silico DNA-DNA hybridization showed it had less than 70% sequence similarity with other Enterobacter species. The average nucleotide identity of EB-247T exhibited less than 95% sequence similarity to all the compared Enterobacter species supporting it’s a new species. From these results, we conclude that EB-247T possesses sufficient characteristics that are different from known Enterobacter species, and should be considered to be a novel species. The name Enterobacter bugandensis sp. nov. is proposed for isolate EB-247T (=DSM 29888T=NCCB 100573T).",,99.5,98.4,100,0.6,,Good,2018-05-29T17:31:13.315Z,2018-05-29T17:31:13.315Z

Isolate passaged 9 times in embyonated chicken eggs, 6 Vero E6 tissue culture passages, and pooled from 1-3 passages in mouse L929 cells.  Organism was purified from host cells by differential centrifugation and banding In Renografin density gradients and WNA was purified with Qiagen spin columns.Rickettsia. This genus, like other Rickettsial organisms such as Neorickettsia and Anaplasma, is composed of obligate intracellular bacteria. There are two groups, the spotted fever group, and the typhus group. The latter is composed of two organisms, Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi. The bacteria can be transmitted via an arthropod (tick, fleas, mites, and/or lice) to a host organism or maintained transstadially and transovarially in the arthropod.  When pathogenic in humans,  they target endothelial cells and sometimes macrophages. They attach via an adhesin, rickettsial outer membrane proteins A and/or B, and are internalized where they persist as cytoplasmically free organisms. Rickettsia typhi. This organism causes murine (endemic) typhus and is an obligate intracellular pathogen that infects both the flea vector and hosts such as humans, commonly  rats, and some other mammals. It is in the typhus group along with R. prowazekii, and genomic comparisons demonstrate colinearity and similarity to the genome of that organism except for two independent inversions near the origin and terminus. In the flea vector, the bacterium penetrates the gut epithelial barrier and is found in the feces which become infective. Rickettsia typhi strain TH1527.

The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree.

Now it was renamed as Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC). This organism causes a chronic lung infection and also causes wound, ear and skin infections. It was also recently reported there was a potential evidence that the majority of MABC infections were acquired through transmission via fomites and aerosols and of recently emerged dominant circulating clones that have spread globally.

This organism is a major cause of urinary tract infection and an important source of nosocomial infection. To date, the spread of multidrug-resistant, even pandrug-resistant, K. pneumoniae has developed into a serious clinical threat. Furthermore, carbapenemases production has recently emerged as an important mechanism for carbapenems resistance. Disturbingly, more and more novel carbapenemases and their variants were continuously discovered. In 2011, we also reported a carbapenem-resistant strain of K. pneumoniae which carried a KPC-2 variant4. In 2010, we isolated another carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strain and then performed bacteriological experiments, PCR and whole-genome sequencing. The genomic sequence data provided us the cause of the carbapenem resistance of this strain.K. pneumoniae JM45 was an isolate from the blood of a 72-year-old male with cerebral infarction after colon carcinoma resection hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the Second Affiliated Hospital of ZheJiang University School of Medcine on April 7, 2010. Species identification was carried out by using Vitek Gram-negative identification cards (bioM¿¿¿¿¿rieux, Marcy l¿¿¿¿¿¿¿Etoile, France) and by 16S rDNA and gyrA sequencing for BLAST searches on Genbank. The minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) were determined by Etest (AB bioMe¿¿¿¿rieux, Solna, Sweden) with the results interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute(CLSI) guidelines. For rapid detection of the presence of AmpC-derepressed, extended-spectrum ¿¿¿¿¿-lactamases(ESBL) and metallo-¿¿¿¿¿-lactamases(MBL), a new system (Cica-Beta-Test, Kanto Chemical, Japan) was utilized. The Modified Hodge Test was carried out to detect carbapenemases.We isolated a pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strain from the blood of a patient with cerbral infarction after colon carcinoma resection in the intensive care unit. According to Cica-Beta-Test and Modified Hodge Test, it was considered to harbor various kinds of ¿¿¿¿¿-lactamases including carbapenemase. However, we only detected four class A ¿¿¿¿¿-lactamase genes with no carbapenemase genes by PCR unexpectedly. To explain the inconsistency of these results, we subsequently conducted whole-genome sequencing for K. pneumoniae JM45. As a result, we also detected four homologous class A ¿¿¿¿¿-lactamase genes, and in addition, discovered two novel genes encoding metallo-¿¿¿¿¿-lactamase domain protein locating on the chromosome simultaneously. This is the first report of two non-cassette-mediated metallo-¿¿¿¿¿-lactamase domain protein sequences for carbapenem resistance in the same strain. We will carry out further research on these two novel genes by cloning and expression analysis followed by enzyme kinetics analysis.",,99.2,96.7,99.3,1.9,,Good,2014-12-08T22:11:49.455Z,2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z

The sequencing confirmed that isolates in the larger outbreak were serotype O12 and further revealed that they belonged to the ST111 sequence type which is a major epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa throughout Europe. As this is the first reported sequence of an ST111 strain, the genome was examined in depth, focusing particularly on antibiotic resistance and potential virulence genes, and on the reported regions of genome plasticity. High degrees of sequence similarity were discovered between outbreak isolates collected from recently infected patients, sinks, an isolate from the sewer and an historical isolate, suggesting that the ST111 strain has been endemic in the hospital for many years.

Out of four species of Shigella, S. flexneri is the most prevalent enteric pathogen in developing countries. Shigella is transmitted through faecal-oral route and can cause gastrointestinal infection via an exceptionally low infectious dose (as many as 10 bacteria). S. flexneri is classified into different serotypes based on the O-antigen structure of its lipopolysaccharide. The serotype conversion is mediated by bacteriophages and plasmids carrying genes that modify the O-antigen. The S. flexneri serotype 1c is a novel serotype, which has now been found to be prevalent in many developing countries. However, little is known about its virulence signatures and evolution. Here, we provide the unique features of this serotype through the whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools. We also identified it as a highly adaptive pathogen with unique O-antigen modification possibly mediated by three different bacteriophages during its evolution. Furthermore, this serotype possesses several hypothetical genes and putative bacteriophage regions that will guide future investigation to identify novel genes involved in pathogen’s virulence and its survival in the host environment.;many frameshifted proteins",collected_by:Nils I.

In Thailand, Leptospira interrogans is a major cause of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis patients present with the wide range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic, mild infections to severe illness involving organ failures. For better understanding the difference between Leptopira isolates causing mild and severe leptospirosis, illumina sequencing was used to sequence genomic DNA in both serotype. DNA of Leptospira isolated from 2 patietns, one with mild and another with severe symptoms, were inlcuded in this study. The paired-end reads were removed adapters and trimmed with Q30 score using Trimmomatic. Trimmed reads were constructed to contigs and scaffolds using Spades. Cross-contamination of scaffolds was evaluated by ContEst16s. Prokka tool for bacterial annotation was used to annotate sequences from both Leptospira isolates. Predicted amino acid sequences from Prokka were searched to EggNOG and David gene ontology database for finding gene ontology. In addition, Leptospira from mild and severe patients annotated that passed the criteria e-value < 10e-5 from blastp against virulence factor database were used to analysis with venn diagram. From this study, we found 13 and 12 genes that unique in the isolates from mild and severe patietns, respectively.
