# PATHGENN
## PATHobiont GENRE eNsemble
This repository contains the database of 914 GENREs of all known human bacterial pathobionts along with their corresponding MEMOTE benchmarking scores and associated metadata downloaded from BV-BRC.
 
### /GENREs
This folder contains all genome scale metabolic network reconstructions. The file names in the GENREs folder are the BV-BRC genome ids. 

### /MEMOTE
This folder contains all .html MEMOTE reports for each of the 914 GENREs. html files may not be easily readable, summary of results is available in MemoteScores.xlsx

### BVBRC_Strains_Metadata.xlsx
Excel file containing names, BV-BRC ids, and metadata associated with each of the genomes used to create the GENREs of PATHGENN
